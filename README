This is an experiment in social courtesy, hacking, and application deployment.  Tragedy of the commons dictates
that such an application, if usable, will render the [FORUM] mailing list unusable.  We shall see.

Originally deployed on Sunday, April 26th 2015, before BACC exams settle in.

Feel free to fork, PR and otherwise lamblast the developers behind this application.
